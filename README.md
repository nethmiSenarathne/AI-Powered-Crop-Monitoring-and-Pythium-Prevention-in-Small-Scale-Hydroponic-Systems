# AI-Powered-Crop-Monitoring-and-Pythium-Prevention-in-Small-Scale-Hydroponic-Systems 

## **Research Problem**  
Small-scale hydroponic farmers in Sri Lanka face significant challenges in managing plant diseases, particularly **Pythium**, a water mold that thrives in high humidity and temperature. While large-scale farmers have access to advanced technologies for monitoring and prevention, small-scale farmers lack such tools. This disparity leads to devastating crop losses, threatening their sustainability and productivity. Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensure the resilience of small-scale hydroponic farming, especially in regions prone to climate change and environmental fluctuations.  

## **Proposed Solution**  
Our system integrates AI and IoT technologies to provide affordable, accessible, and effective solutions for small-scale hydroponic farmers. It leverages historical and real-time data to predict, detect, and mitigate Pythium outbreaks while optimizing crop yield through predictive analytics.
